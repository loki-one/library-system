//Use of IIFE: to hide other varibles in the library except the ones you want to share with rest of the program

// 1. Create: Run the library in IIFE and attach to window.
// 2. Use: Access library from window (globally).
//With this approach we are attaching one global variable per library so it will cause problem when there are
//100 libraries in our app and this will result in 100 global variables so we need an approach there will be
//just one global variable
